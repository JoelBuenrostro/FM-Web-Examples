# Recipe Page

This is my solution to the [Recipe Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm) on Frontend Mentor. The challenge helped me practice responsive design, semantic HTML, CSS techniques, and integration of local fonts.

## Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5:** Proper use of elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>` to ensure accessibility and semantic correctness.
- **CSS Flexbox:** For creating a flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented with relative units (`rem`, `%`) and media queries for optimal viewing on devices ranging from 375px to large screens.
- **Local Fonts:** Integrated "Young Serif" and "Outfit" for a custom look.
- **Astro Framework:** Used for component structure and easy project management.

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Pixel-perfect Design:**
   Adapted the layout and styles to match the Figma and challenge designs for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

2. **Font Integration:**
   Used local font files and `@font-face` for Young Serif and Outfit, ensuring correct weights and fallback.

3. **Responsive Adjustments:**
   Ensured the layout adapts seamlessly to smaller devices by using media queries and flexible units.

4. **Customizing Design Elements:**
   Used CSS variables to manage colors and spacing consistently across the project.

### Retrospective

This project allowed me to enhance my understanding of responsive design, font integration, and accessibility. If I were to revisit this, I would explore integrating a CSS preprocessor like SASS and add more accessibility features.
