# Social links profile

This is my solution to the [Social links profile challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ) on Frontend Mentor. The challenge helped me practice responsive design, semantic HTML, and CSS techniques.

## Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5:** Proper use of elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>` to ensure accessibility and semantic correctness.
- **CSS Flexbox:** For creating a flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented with relative units (`rem`, `%`) and media queries for optimal viewing on devices ranging from 320px to large screens.
- **Google Fonts:** ntegrated the "Inter" font family for a clean and professional look.
- **Astro Framework:** Used for component structure and easy project management.

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Hover Interactions:**
   Implemented smooth transitions for background and text color on social links using CSS ease-in-out for better user experience.

2. **Maintaining Accessibility:**
   Added aria-label attributes to social links for better compatibility with screen readers.

3. **Responsive Adjustments:**
   Ensured the layout adapts seamlessly to smaller devices by using media queries and flexible units.

4. **Customizing Design Elements:**
   Used CSS variables to manage colors and spacing consistently across the project.

### Retrospective

This project allowed me to enhance my understanding of responsive design and accessibility. If I were to revisit this, I would explore integrating a CSS preprocessor like SASS to handle styles in a more scalable manner and potentially add animations for dynamic interactions.
