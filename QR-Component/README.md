# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Challenge

This is my solution to the [QR Code Component Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) on Frontend Mentor. The challenge helped me practice responsive design, semantic HTML, and CSS techniques.

## Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5:** Proper use of elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>` to ensure accessibility and semantic correctness.
- **CSS Flexbox:** For creating a flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented with relative units (`rem`, `%`) and media queries for optimal viewing on devices ranging from 320px to large screens.
- **Google Fonts:** Integrated the "Outfit" font family with weights 400 and 700.
- **Astro Framework:** Used for component structure and easy project management.

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Ensuring Responsiveness:**
   Fixed layout dimensions caused issues on smaller screens. I resolved this by using relative units like `%` and `rem` and incorporating `media queries` to adjust styles for various breakpoints.

2. **Maintaining Accessibility:**
   Added descriptive `alt` attributes for images and used `aria-labelledby` in the `<section>` to associate it with its title, enhancing screen reader navigation.

3. **Organizing Styles:**
   Adopted the **BEM methodology** for class naming and structured the CSS into a modular, maintainable format.

### Retrospective

I am proud of creating a fully responsive and accessible design. If I were to redo this project, I would explore adding subtle animations for a more dynamic user experience and potentially refactor the styles using a CSS preprocessor like SASS for better scalability.
