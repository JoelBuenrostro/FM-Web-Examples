## Overview

### The Challenge

The **Blog Preview Card** project is part of the [Frontend Mentor Challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io). This challenge focuses on creating a responsive and accessible blog preview card that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.

Users should be able to:

- View the card layout with clean and semantic HTML.
- Interact with hover and focus states for all interactive elements.
- Experience an optimized design across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

---

### Key Features

1. **Responsive Design**:
   - The card adjusts dynamically using CSS Flexbox and media queries.
   - Fluid widths and font scaling ensure a seamless experience from small to large screens.

2. **Accessible Components**:
   - Proper use of semantic HTML tags like `<article>`, `<img alt>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>`.
   - Visual hierarchy established with headings, colors, and spacing.

3. **Custom Styling**:
   - Fully customizable through CSS custom properties (`:root`) for colors, font sizes, and spacing.
   - Local integration of the **Figtree** font family for consistent typography.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Minimal external dependencies.
   - Self-hosted assets for fast loading and offline availability.
