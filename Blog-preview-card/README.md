### What I learned

While working on this project, I focused on:

Improving Accessibility:

Using descriptive alt attributes for images.
Implementing ARIA roles where necessary for better screen reader support.
Responsive Design:

Media queries and relative units like % and rem for fluid layouts.
Ensuring a smooth experience on all devices, from mobile to large screens.
CSS Best Practices:

Using CSS variables for scalable and maintainable styles.
Avoiding fixed heights and relying on padding and flexbox for content spacing.
